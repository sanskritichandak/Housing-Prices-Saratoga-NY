**Housing-Prices-Saratoga-NY**

Abstract

The housing crisis in the United States has impacted the housing market in numerous ways. In tandem with the pandemic, Upstate New York is experiencing a surge in prices and an increase in demand for housing. However, the $200 million legislation aims to bring market conditions back to pre-COVID times (Bruno, 2022). Therefore, the aim of this study is to predict the prices and probability of having central air for houses in Saratoga, New York. The data is from 2015 and includes information about 16 home features (“StatCrunch,” n.d.). The models created predict how different home features affect the prices of houses and their probability of having central air. The three models created include linear regression, logistic regression, and KNN regression. Since the data set is relatively small, models were created with and without outliers to find the best possible model. The findings indicate that the linear regression model without outliers, logistic regression model with outliers, and KNN regression model without outliers can be used to predict prices and/or the probability of having central air for houses in Saratoga and are better than not using any model.
